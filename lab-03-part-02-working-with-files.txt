books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command, head, on the file to show the contents of the beginning of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).
----------
head books/other/pg1232.txt

==========
18. Using the same file again!

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use tail on the file to show the contents of the end of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).

19. Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use less and more on the file to show the contents of the file.  Try pressing spacebar and/or q afterwards.

Write the command that you used below.  Describe what spacebar and q does after using either less or more.
----------
less books/other/pg1232.txt  more books/other/pg1232.txt
Pressing spacebar makes the page go down and q quits out of the file.


==========
20. Describe what situations you would use the following commands for viewing files: less, more, cat, tail, head

(Some characteristics that may help your description might be the length of the file, whether or not you'd like to read the whole thing... or just the beginning or end, etc.)
----------
Head is useful if you are lookin for a brief summary of the file or at least the first section of it.
Tail is for searching for the ending file or material referenced by the file.
Less 
More
Cat shows all the content of a file, making it useful if you want a thorough rundown of the code.
